# Custom-Four-Step-Demand-Model-From-Scratch
Manual implementation of the classic Four-Step Travel Demand Model using Python, applied to a synthetic 5-zone city. Built entirely from scratch without simulation software for hands-on understanding and practice.

# Four-Step Urban Travel Demand Model â€“ Synthetic 5-Zone City

This project demonstrates a full implementation of the classic four-step travel demand model, using synthetic data for a five-zone city. All code was written in Python and executed in Google Colab.

## Overview

The four modeling steps included are:

1. **Trip Generation**  
   Estimated productions and attractions using regression-style equations and synthetic socioeconomic data.

2. **Trip Distribution**  
   Implemented a doubly-constrained gravity model with impedance function \( f(c_{ij}) = \frac{1}{t_{ij}^2} \).

3. **Mode Choice**  
   Split total trips between Auto and Transit using a utility-based logit model.

4. **Traffic Assignment**  
   Performed all-or-nothing assignment for Auto trips using NetworkX with Dijkstra's shortest-path.
